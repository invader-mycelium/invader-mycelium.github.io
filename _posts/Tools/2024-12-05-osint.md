# Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) Tools Lab

This post details a laboratory exercise exploring common OSINT tools used by penetration testers, focusing on **SpiderFoot** and **Recon-ng** for passive reconnaissance and gathering information about a company and its employees.

## Part 1: Examining OSINT Resources

Passive reconnaissance utilizes **open and publicly accessible data** to guide active efforts and gather information about a company and its employees. The objectives of OSINT include:
* Determining the organization's **digital footprint**.
* Determining what data about the organization is available to cybercriminals.

### The OSINT Framework

The **OSINT Framework** ($\text{https://osintframework.com/}$) provides a useful way to visualize the available OSINT tools and resources.

One example tool found through the framework under **Username** $\rightarrow$ **Username Search Engines** is **WhatsMyName (T)**, which searches for a username across various sites ($\text{https://whatsmyname.app/}$).

> **Reflection:** Why perform username searches and account enumeration?
> Searching for usernames can identify accounts that important company personnel may have on various sites. Hackers may gain access to personnel information, including passwords, addresses, and phone numbers, if other sites are vulnerable. These details can be used in **social engineering attacks**.

### SMART - Start Me Aggregated Resource Tool

The service $\text{https://smart.myosint.training/}$ finds all OSINT-related links that people have bookmarked and shared on the popular bookmark manager, $\text{start.me}$.

## Part 2: Using SpiderFoot

**SpiderFoot** is an automated OSINT scanner included with Kali. It queries over $\text{1000}$ open information sources and presents the results in an easy-to-use GUI. SpiderFoot seeds its scan with targets such as:
* Domain names
* IP addresses
* Email addresses

### Launching SpiderFoot

SpiderFoot is launched from the terminal and accessed via a web browser:

```bash
$ spiderfoot -l 127.0.0.1:5001
````

You can then access the web interface from your browser.

SpiderFoot organizes its scans into "use cases", with notable ones being:

• Footprint: To understand the target's network perimeter and associated identities.

• Investigate: Focused on targets you suspect have malicious behavior.

• Passive: A scan designed not to alert the target, a pure form of passive OSINT.

Important Note: Unless you have explicit permission, it is recommended to use passive scans to avoid any issues related to unauthorized scanning.

The tool is modular, with over 200 "scanners" or modules. Some of them can improve their functionality if you provide them with API keys, many of which can be obtained through free registration on various services.

Part 3: Going Deeper with Recon-ng

Recon-ng is a very powerful reconnaissance framework with a modular structure similar to Metasploit. Its main advantage is its organization and the ability to execute complex tasks simply.

Key Recon-ng Concepts:

1\. Workspaces: They allow you to isolate investigations from each other. You can have a workspace for each client or project, keeping data and module settings separate. To manage them, you use commands like `workspaces create <name>` or `workspaces list`.

2\. Marketplace: Recon-ng doesn't come with all modules pre-installed. It has a "marketplace" (a GitHub repository) from where you can search for and install the modules you need. Useful commands are `marketplace search <term>` and `marketplace install <module_path>`.

Running a Module (Practical Example):

Let's find subdomains of `hackxor.net` using the `bing_domain_web` module.

1\. Install the module:

3\. Load the module:

4\. Set the option: In Recon-ng, you first configure the options and then run the module.

6\. Execute:

The results are automatically saved in a database associated with the workspace. You can see a summary with the `dashboard` command or list the found hosts with `show hosts`.

Part 4: Discovering Interesting Files

One of the most common reconnaissance tasks is searching for files that shouldn't be public. Recon-ng has modules for this, such as `discovery/info_disclosure/interesting_files`.

The process is the same: you install it from the marketplace, load it, set the `SOURCE` (for example, `h4cker.org`), and run it. This module will search for files like `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, backups, etc., and save the results in a `.csv` file for analysis.
